jettyRun - Deploys a Jetty server in http://localhost:8080, using the files located on the project's source directory.
This allows to modify any of these files and be able to see the changes in hot. Beware! If we modify any .java file, 
we will hace to compile them again on another terminal with 'gradle classes'.

jettyWar - Deploys a Jetty server in http://localhost:8080, using the .war file generated by the project. With this option
we won't be able to see any modification in hot, but in exachange it'll allow us to test the .war after the compiling and 
packaging process.
